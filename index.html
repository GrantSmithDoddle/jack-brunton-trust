                    <p>Jack Brunton was a fifth-generation farmer in a North Yorkshire family. After growing up on the farm in Nunthorpe, Jack took over the running of the farm from his father and progressed the business by buying neigbouring farms in the area. </p>
                    <p>In 1969 he bought an estate of 2800 acres in the Bilsdale area and took up the difficult challenge of hill farming. Building up a herd of pedigree Ayrshire cattle became his passion and he was a great success with many of his animals, winning trophies at multiple dairy shows.</p>
                    <p>He continued to work and help young famers clubs in the region and was hugely inspired by trees of which he planted many different species and varieties around his properties and this is now reflected in the essence of the charity today.</p>

                        <p>The Jack Brunton Charitable Trust received a request from Whitby &#38; District Community Transport, for a grant. They needed the grant to be able to replace their Multiple Person Vehicle, as it was becoming unreliable and costly
                            due to its age. They rely heavily on the transport as it is used to help the elderly and disabled travel around the region.</p>
                        <p>We were delighted to provide a grant of £2,000 to help support the charity. In doing so, it contributed to replace their unreliable vehicle with a VW Transporter mini bus, which runs at a lower cost for the charity.</p>

                        <p>We recently received a request from the Charity Blue Cross for Pets, who are known for their dedication to helping sick and injured pets. They requested a grant to pay for healthcare products for cats and dogs at the nearby home
                            in Thirsk.</p>
                        <p>The Jack Burnton Charitable Trust were able to provide the grant of £1000, which the Blue Cross were incredibly grateful for and were able to put the money to good use providing more healthcare products for the animals.</p>

                        <p>After consideration, we were pleased to present the donation of £3,000 to the Trust, to help support their funds for the two housing schemes.</p>

                        <p>The Yorkshire Air Ambulance applied for a donation for the Jack Brunton Trust in order to provide funds towards providing patient mattresses, paramedic response bags and an engine compressor washer system.</p>
