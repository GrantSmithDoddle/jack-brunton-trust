                <p>Jack Brunton was a fifth-generation farmer from a North Riding of Yorkshire family. After growing up on the farm in Nunthorpe, Jack eventually took over from his father and progressed the business by buying neighbouring farms in the area.</p>
                <p>His pedigree herd of Ayrshire cattle became his passion and he won many trophies with his animals at agricultural shows. In 1969, he bought an estate of 2800 acres in the Bilsdale area and took up the difficult challenge of hill farming.</p>
                <p>He continued to work and help young farmers’ clubs in the region and was hugely inspired by trees. He planted a variety of species around his properties and his love of the area and its people led to the creation of the Trust.</p>

                    <p><strong>Whitby charity</strong></p>
                    <p>The Jack Brunton Charitable Trust received a request from Whitby &amp; District Community Transport, for a grant. They needed the funds to be able to replace their Multiple Person Vehicle, as it was becoming unreliable and costly due to its age. They rely heavily on the vehicle as it is used to help the elderly and disabled travel around the region.</p>
                    <p>The Trustees delighted to provide a grant of £2,000 to help support the charity. In doing so, it contributed to the replacement of the unreliable vehicle with the purchase of a new Transporter mini bus, which runs at a lower cost.</p>
