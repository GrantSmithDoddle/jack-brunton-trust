                <p>Jack Brunton was a fifth-generation farmer from a North Riding of Yorkshire family. After growing up on the farm in Nunthorpe, Jack eventually took over from his father and progressed the business by buying neighbouring farms in the area.</p>
                <p>His pedigree herd of Ayrshire cattle became his passion and he won many trophies with his animals at agricultural shows. In 1969, he bought an estate of 2800 acres in the Bilsdale area and took up the difficult challenge of hill farming.</p>
                <p>He continued to work and help young farmers’ clubs in the region and was hugely inspired by trees. He planted a variety of species around his properties and his love of the area and its people led to the creation of the Trust.</p>

                    <p><strong>Whitby Charity</strong></p>
                    <p>The Jack Brunton Charitable Trust received a request from Whitby &amp; District Community Transport, for a grant. They needed the funds to be able to replace their Multiple Person Vehicle, as it was becoming unreliable and costly due to its age. They rely heavily on the vehicle as it is used to help the elderly and disabled travel around the region.</p>
                    <p>The Trustees delighted to provide a grant of £2,000 to help support the charity. In doing so, it contributed to the replacement of the unreliable vehicle with the purchase of a new Transporter mini bus, which runs at a lower cost.</p>

                    <p>We recently received a request from the charity Blue Cross, who are known for their dedication to helping sick and injured pets. They requested a grant to pay for healthcare products for cats and dogs at the nearby home in Thirsk.</p>
                    <p>The Jack Brunton Charitable Trust were able to provide the grant of £1000.</p>

                    <p>The Church Housing Trust appealed to the Jack Brunton Charitable Trust for a donation to support funds for their two residential houses. The Church Housing Trust provides rooms and support for homeless people and those suffering from the effects of substance abuse.</p>
                    <p>After careful consideration, The Jack Brunton Charitable Trust awarded a donation of £3,000 to the Trust, to help support the funds for the two housing schemes.</p>

                    <p>The Yorkshire Air Ambulance applied for a donation to build funds to purchase patient mattresses, paramedic response bags and an engine compressor washer system.</p>
                    <p>The Jack Brunton Charitable Trust considered the request and were delighted to grant a donation of £7,500.</p>
